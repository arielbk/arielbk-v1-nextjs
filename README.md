This is my personal website and portfolio. It is a platform to showcase my web development projects.  I was really attracted by the performance and SEO benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) and this was my first time using NextJS and coming to terms with SSR.

## Tech stack
- NextJS
- React
- Styled Components

## Test and deploy
`npm run dev` to start the development server.

`npm run build && npm run export` to export the site as static HTML ready to upload to any webserver.
Because it is not overly dynamic, this was the easiest and most performant way to get the site running on a simple web server.
