        This simple app was my first foray into the React world, and it was an app that I had originally written in pure JavaScript. Migrating an app, even a simple one like this, was a great learning experience.

        The code of the original app was also meant as a learning exercise. The main functionality of the app is to split up all the words given as input, remove any capitalisation and punctuation, and for each word to add them to a tally. Easier said than done.

        Chaining together modern JavaScript higher order methods allowed me to accomplish this efficiently and with few lines of code that still remained readable.
