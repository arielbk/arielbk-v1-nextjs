      <h4>Lucid</h4>
        <p>
          This was a project that I undertook as part of a 'Chingu Cohort', a community coding project. I teamed up with two other members to work on a front-end project of our choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is currently a proof-of-concept â€” a fully functional frontend-only app.

          I view this as my first full-fledged React app, and it is one that I completely rewrote many times as I learnt more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I completed my first version of the app, I learnt how to use Sketch for interface design and realised how powerful time spent in the design phase of a project can be.

      <div class="project-text">
        <h4>Date Facts</h4>
        <p>
          This app was great practice for fetching data from an external API (Number Facts API, in this case) and displaying the content dynamically, fetching new data without a page reload.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had the opportunity to play with the relatively new CSS variables feature. As the user moves their mouse around the app window, the theme colours cycle through the rainbow. I enjoyed making this novel flair.

          This simple app was my first foray into the React world, and it was an app that I had originally written in pure JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Migrating an app, even a simple one like this, was a great learning experience.

          This was a design/coding collaboration for the user experience designer Marija Peraic's personal portfolio page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working with a trained UX designer was a valuable experience and gave me some insight into the methods and workflows in developing a project with the end user in mind.

            This was the final project for a three month long online computer science course, Harvard's CS50X.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students had free reign to apply some of the technologies and concepts we had learnt during the twelve weeks and build a project of our own.
