  <section>
    <h3>Who is arielbk?</h3>
    <p>A New Zealander with German and Irish heritage living in Croatia.</p>
    <p>Fascinated by web design and development from a young age, I built my first website in Dreamweaver when I was 8. It was a Pok√©mon games website with '90s animated GIFs and MIDI music. I was so proud.</p>
    <p>After that I taught myself HTML, and eventually CSS (when it was first released and the face of the Web changed). I started designing and coding websites for family friends and local businesses in Notepad.</p>
    <p>After finishing my Bachelor's degree in History and English at the start of 2018 I decided to dive head-first into modern web development.</p>
