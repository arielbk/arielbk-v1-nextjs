        What kind of direction do I want to take with this? What is my goal/purpose and to what extend do I (on reflection) achieve this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Design first, then code. Again, I'm resisting the urge to just jump into coding without having a clear plan of content and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first project where I have started using Figma for design. How has this helped me and how has it hindered me? For one thing, it is entirely online... This is pretty annoying if I don't have an Internet connection like here in Polaća.

      <h4>Lucid</h4>
      <p>
        This was a project that I undertook as part of a 'Chingu Cohort', a community coding project. I teamed up with two other members to work on a front-end project of our choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the most experienced coder in the group I spearheaded the project and led the other team members through the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a long-time productivity app user, I wanted to create a minimal task manager that could be extensible. Something that was simple to use, but powerful when you dig deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is currently a proof-of-concept — a fully functional frontend-only app.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was great practice for designing minimalistically and incorporating smooth CSS transition animations, as well as some small SVG graphics. I gained a deeper understanding of the React component system. The project really demanded it.

      <h4>Pomodoro Timer</h4>
      <p>
        I view this as my first full-fledged React app, and it is one that I completely rewrote many times as I learnt more and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I completed my first version of the app, I learnt how to use Sketch for interface design and realised how powerful time spent in the design phase of a project can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about and planning the user experience before writing a line of code is important, and steers the entire project.</p>
      <p>
        It changed the way I thought about effective software design: the user experience comes first, and the code is a way to make that happen. Both require problem-solving and creative thinking.

      <h4>Date Facts</h4>
      <p>
        This app was great practice for fetching data from an external API (Number Facts API, in this case) and displaying the content dynamically, fetching new data without a page reload.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had the opportunity to play with the relatively new CSS variables feature. As the user moves their mouse around the app window, the theme colours cycle through the rainbow. I enjoyed making this novel flair.

      <h4>Word Counter</h4>
      <p>
        This simple app was my first foray into the React world, and it was an app that I had originally written in pure JavaScript. Migrating an app, even a simple one like this, was a great learning experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code of the original app was also meant as a learning exercise. The main functionality of the app is to split up all the words given as input, remove any capitalisation and punctuation, and for each word to add them to a tally. Easier said than done.
      </p>  
      <p>  
        Chaining together modern JavaScript higher order methods allowed me to accomplish this efficiently and with few lines of code that still remained readable.

      <h4>Marija P portfolio</h4>
      <p>
        This was a design/coding collaboration for the user experience designer Marija Peraic's personal portfolio page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Bootstrap as a front-end library, modified some of the default Bootstrap styles and incorporated the Sass CSS extension into my workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with an trained UX designer was a valuable experience and gave me some insight into the methods and workflows in developing a project with the end user in mind.

            This was the final project for a three month long online computer science course, Harvard's CS50X.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students had free reign to apply some of the technologies and concepts we had learnt during the twelve weeks and build a project of our own.
