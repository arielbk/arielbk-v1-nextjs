    <h4>Pomodoro Timer</h4>
    <p>
      I view this as my first full-fledged React app, and it is one that I completely rewrote many times as I learnt more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      After I completed my first version of the app, I learnt how to use Sketch for interface design and realised how powerful time spent in the design phase of a project can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about and planning the user experience before writing a line of code is important, and steers the entire project.</p>
    <p>
      It changed the way I thought about effective software design: the user experience comes first, and the code is a way to make that happen. Both require problem-solving and creative thinking.
