    <h4>Lucid</h4>

      This was a project that I undertook as part of a 'Chingu Cohort', a community coding project. I teamed up with two other members to work on a front-end project of our choice.

    <p>
      As the most experienced coder in the group I spearheaded the project and led the other team members through the process.

      As a long-time productivity app user, I wanted to create a minimal task manager that could be extensible. Something that was simple to use, but powerful when you dig deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is currently a proof-of-concept â€” a fully functional frontend-only app.

      It was great practice for designing minimalistically and incorporating smooth CSS transition animations, as well as some small SVG graphics. I gained a deeper understanding of the React component system. The project really demanded it.
